Develep is an open-source genetic programming tool that incorporates epigenetic learning.
It is very much under development! Or you could say, under-develeped...

It uses a linear genome for constructing candidate equations. 

Develep is built to include different evolutionary methods for system identification adapted from literature. 

The options include  normal tournament selection, deterministic crowding, lexicase selection, and age-pareto fitness selection. 

HOW TO RUN DEVELEP

Run Develep from the command line. Here is the syntax:

Develep sampleparams.txt sampledata.txt

As you can see, Develep takes two arguments: a parameter file and a data file. The parameter file includes all of the run-time 
settings for your search. The data file includes all your experimental data. See the sampleparams.txt and sampledata.txt files
to see how formatting works.   

HOW TO RUN RUNTRIALS

RunTrials will run Develep for many trials. Here is the syntax:

RunTrials sampletrials.txt

RunTrials takes one input file. The trials file contains three columns:

#trials parameterfile datafile

These are the simple instructions for running Develep.
