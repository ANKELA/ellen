Develep is an open-source genetic programming tool that incorporates epigenetic learning.
It is very much under development! Or you could say, under-develeped...

The files are built in Visual Studio C++ Express 2010 with some boost library dependencies. 

ABOUT

Develep uses a developmental, syntax-free, linear genome for constructing candidate equations. 

It is built to include different evolutionary methods for system identification adapted from literature. The options include  normal tournament selection, deterministic crowding, and age-pareto fitness selection. All algorithm choices are mangaged by one parameter file. 

HOW TO BUILD DEVELEP
The project should be built in Visual Studio 2010 C++ Express, which is free from Microsoft. The boost libraries (also free) should be installed. Lastly, the OpenMP files (which were removed from VS 2010) need to be added to the VS path.

HOW TO RUN DEVELEP

Run Develep from the command line. Here is the syntax:

Develep sampleparams.txt sampledata.txt

As you can see, Develep takes two arguments: a parameter file and a data file. The parameter file includes all of the run-time settings for your search. The data file includes all your experimental data. See the sampleparams.txt and sampledata.txt filesto see how formatting works.   

HOW TO RUN RUNTRIALS

RunTrials will run Develep for many trials. Here is the syntax:

RunTrials sampletrials.txt

RunTrials takes one input file. The trials file contains three columns:

#trials parameterfile datafile

These are the simple instructions for running Develep.
